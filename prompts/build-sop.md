"To start with, please create an overview SOP file in the SOP folder, name it overview.md, and break down all of the steps that we need to create the bare bones minimum version of this product. Make sure to mark the user authentication Laravel stuff as being checked (using markdown checkboxes) and that one should be checked by default. We don’t need to talk about deployment or testing at this point, I just want the very basic steps to get a working version of the app."
